# Console version of “Guess the Footballer” quiz in Swift. 

## The project is inspired by [GUI game of the same name] (https://futbol-11.com/guess-the-footballer).

## The rules of the game are quite simple: you have to guess a soccer player.

- The player has the opportunity to ask **10 questions about him** (league and club he plays for, position on the pitch and nationality) and **3 attempts to give the correct answer**.

- It's worth noting that I already wrote [the same game in C#] (https://github.com/t3mv-l/Guess-the-football-player-quiz) at the very beginning of my journey of learning programming. Perhaps I will soon get my hands on refactoring it :)
